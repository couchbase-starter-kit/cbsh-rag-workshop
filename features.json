    "title": "GSI Vector Indexes",
    "category": "features",
    "text": "Couchbase Server 8.0 introduces Hyperscale Vector indexes and Composite Vector indexes in the Index Service, enabling vector-search workloads (e.g., for AI applications). Hyperscale supports single vector column for very large datasets; Composite supports one vector plus scalar filters for hybrid vector+scalar queries, alongside existing Search Vector indexes."

    "title": "Storage Engine Default Change – Magma with 128 vBuckets",
    "category": "data_service",
    "text": "The default storage engine for new buckets in Couchbase Server 8.0 Enterprise is now Magma with 128 vBuckets; its minimum memory quota is 100 MiB (vs 1 GiB for the previous default). This is a behavior change so upgrade scripts relying on previous defaults should be reviewed."

    "title": "Native Encryption at Rest",
    "category": "data_service",
    "text": "Couchbase Server Enterprise now supports native encryption at rest for bucket data, logs, audit and configuration, with support for third-party key management (e.g., AWS KMS or KMIP-compliant services). Encryption/decryption is transparent to users."

    "title": "Filesystem Free-Space Protection",
    "category": "data_service",

    "category": "data_service",
    "text": "A new cluster-level option allows durable writes to succeed even when majority write requirements are not met (for example under some failover/upgrade scenarios). This relaxes the guarantee of durability and should only be used in special cases."

    "category": "cluster_service",
    "text": "The Bucket REST API now supports new settings: ‘accessScannerEnabled’, ‘expiryPagerSleepTime’, ‘warmupBehavior’, ‘memoryLowWatermark’, ‘memoryHighWatermark’. Older cbepctl parameters (warmup thresholds, mem_high_wat etc.) are removed."

    "title": "XDCR Conflict Logging & Diagnostic Utilities",
    "category": "replication",
    "text": "XDCR enhancements: conflict logging (records the two conflicting documents + event in a local collection when active-active replication conflicts occur), incoming replication identification (which remote clusters are sending streams), ‘xdcrDiffer’ CLI utility to compare document data across clusters, and new genericServicesLogLevel configuration via REST API."
  },
  {
    "title": "Hybrid Authentication Mode & Node-to-Node Encryption",
    "category": "security",
    "text": "Couchbase Server 8.0 supports a ‘Hybrid’ authentication mode: clients can use either certificates or username/password credentials, while all nodes must use mutual TLS (mTLS) for inter-node communication. Also supports simultaneous certificate-based client auth and node-to-node encryption in the mandatory mode."
